# Remaining Work
- The next state is broken; the neighbor count and game rules application is incorrect
- We need to use the setTimeout function to continuously calculate next states and update the view
- Would like to add user input for grid size
- Need to add randomFill button for randomly putting in a bunch of 'cells'
- Would be cool to convert to using the HTML5 canvas
